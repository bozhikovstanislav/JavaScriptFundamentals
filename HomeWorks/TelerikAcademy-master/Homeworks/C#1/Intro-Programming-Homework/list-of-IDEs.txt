Perform a research (eg in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a
short list with popular development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio.

First of all I have to mention Jet-Brain's IDEs.
PhpStorm, WebStorm, intelliJ IDEA and so on.
All of them are great and I strongly recommend them.

For the Linux-lovers who also want to program in C #, Mono is a must.
It is really easy to use, but it's not all good - it has really poor
intellisense, if any, and it does not provide all the features that VS does.

Eclipse - maybe the most popular Java IDE out there. I really like it
although in my opinion IntelliJ IDEA is better.

Code :: Blocks is primarily used for C and C ++. It's not a bad IDE, but not
the best one either.
